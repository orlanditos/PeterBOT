### Bots don't join my Server
```
Please make sure to use the correct Minecraft Version.
    make sure that if you use PeterBot in Cracked Mode, you only use it on Cracked Servers.
    maybe try adding a delay, for example a delay of 5000 equals to 5 seconds.
    if you are using Proxy's make sure to use it on a Server which is publicly accessible.
    please verify that the IP and Port are correct.
```

### Only one Bot joins
```
If only one Bot joins it is most likley of the default join delay set on minecraft
servers, there are 2 solutions for this problem. First solution is to just set the Join
Delay to 5000, this way the Bots will join slower. Second solution is to change it
in the server file called "bukkit.yml", look for the option connection-throttle and set
it to 0.
```

### Where do i find the cracked.txt
```
Well basically there isn't, if you run PeterBot in Cracked Mode, you only need
to create a file which contains random names and save it in .txt format
If you run it in Premium Mode, you need to create a file withe the format:
email:password       1 line equals one account
```

### Where is the Macro file
```
just create macro files in .txt format, u can find example macros in the "example files" folder on github
```
